## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Changeset-style fragment format with frontmatter for specifying version bump type
- New `get-bump-type.mjs` script to automatically determine version bump from fragments
- Automatic version bumping on merge to main based on changelog fragments
- Detailed documentation for the changelog fragment system in `changelog.d/README.md`

### Changed
- Updated `collect-changelog.mjs` to strip frontmatter when collecting fragments
- Updated `version-and-commit.mjs` to handle frontmatter in fragments
- Enhanced release workflow to automatically determine bump type from changesets

### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)
- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Changeset-style fragment format with frontmatter for specifying version bump type
- New `get-bump-type.mjs` script to automatically determine version bump from fragments
- Automatic version bumping on merge to main based on changelog fragments
- Detailed documentation for the changelog fragment system in `changelog.d/README.md`

### Changed
- Updated `collect-changelog.mjs` to strip frontmatter when collecting fragments
- Updated `version-and-commit.mjs` to handle frontmatter in fragments
- Enhanced release workflow to automatically determine bump type from changesets

### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)
- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.
